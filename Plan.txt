1. Our task is to create the game of hangman with a single client application connecting to a server application. Clients make guesses and the server handles the game logic for hangman. If a guess is correct the server will fill in all instances of the character in the secret word, then send the updated display to the client. If a guess is incorrect the server will decrement the number of guesses, and report to the client. We will be using the Socket API in C to implement the client and server connections and interactions.  
2. We think it will be difficult to get started on this project and organize an abstract plan of how to implement the project. Also since neither of us have used the Socket API before we expect to run into complications while using the various system calls.
3. We plan to use the Man pages via our terminal, lecture materials and the book, as well as asking other classmates when we get really stuck.
4. We plan on meeting Monday,Wednesday and Friday from 1-2 PM as well as a set of 2-3 hours on Thursdays and Weekends for 2-3 hours or more depending on our current progress.
